# GTC2018 - Instructor-Led Lab: *Best GPU Code Practices Combining OpenACC, CUDA, and OmpSs*

> This lab is shold to be executed inside nvidia-docker with hopobcn/gtc2018-fwi:eu image

## Lab Instructions

In this lab you will make modifications to a real world oil&gas mini application called `FWI`.
You will compile and execute the newly enhanced code in each step.
Along the way, solutions are provided, so you can check your work, or take a peek if you get lost.

After login into the machine you should see a folder called `FWI` containing each *step* and *solution* as a different branch:

```bash
~# git branch
* gtc2018-step1
  gtc2018-step1-sol
  gtc2018-step3
  gtc2018-step3-sol
  gtc2018-step4
  gtc2018-step4-sol
  gtc2018-step5
  gtc2018-step5-sol
  ompss-openacc
```

Use `git diff <branch-name>` to compare branches and `git stash && git checkout <branch-name>` to discard non-commited changes and change to another step (branch).

###### Execution setup info (examples):

   Dual socket Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5-2630 v3 (Haswell) @ 2.40 GHz with 8 cores (16 core total, HT off)
   NVIDIA Tesla K80

## Step 0: Characterize FWI and identify Available Parallelism

> To save time, this step has been moved to Appendix 0

To compare our GPU executions we will use serial & OpenMP executions:

* Sequential execution with 1 core:
```bash
Number of frequencies 1
Number of shots 1
Number of gradient iterations 1
Number of test iterations 1
Output directory path: results
FWI Program finished in 1059.629833 seconds
```
* OpenMP execution with 16 threads (1 per core)
```bash
Number of frequencies 1
Number of shots 1
Number of gradient iterations 1
Number of test iterations 1
Output directory path: results
FWI Program finished in 120.587904 seconds
```


## Step 1: Express parallelism with OpenACC directives

In this step, you have to add compute regions around expensive loops in the application. 
We assume you already have some OpenACC knowledge.

In this lab we have used the **kernels** directive extensively but the **loop** directive could also been used.

To reduce time, we will suppose we have profiled the mini-app and we got this results (see Appendix 0):

```bash
Number of frequencies 1
Number of shots 1
Number of gradient iterations 1
Number of test iterations 1
Output directory path: results
FWI Program finished in 1059.575686 seconds

  5.15%  54.5714s  compute_component_vcell_TL

======== Data collected at 100Hz frequency
======== Percentage threshold: 1%
```
We can see that `scell` and `vcell` functions dominate the execution time.
`IDX` is the function that linearizes the (i,j,k) triplet into the linear index.
Usually the compiler is smart enough to inline it, but in this execution it didn't.
Since we know that `IDX` is only called inside `scell` and `vcell` functions, we can safely split the `IDX` execution time among `scell` and `vcell` functions.
Therefore we can safely say that `scell` and `vcell` accounts for the 99% of the execution time of the application.

If we take a look at those functions in **src/fwi_propagator.c** we will arrive to this conclusions:
1. They are embarrassingly parallel
2. All `TR`/`TR`/`BL`/`BR` are very similar
3. We have to apply the same parallelization strategy for all *scell* and *vcell* functions.



In this first implementation we are going to use CUDA Unified Memory.
For that purpose we already modified **CMakeLists.txt** to add the `managed` to the `-ta=tesla` openacc target:
```cmake
set(OpenACC_C_FLAGS "${OpenACC_C_FLAGS} -ta=tesla,cuda8.0,cc20,cc35,cc50,cc60,lineinfo,managed")
```



> To facilitate your work we already implemented the majority of `openacc` pragmas leaving `vcell_TL` and `scell_TR` for you to implement.

##### In sumary:
You have to add a `#pragma acc kernels` in the outer-most loop of `src/fwi_propagator.c:166` (`compute_component_vcell_TL`) and `src/fwi_propagator.c:634` (`compute_component_scell_TR`). 
Example for `vcell_TL`:
```c
#pragma acc kernels
for(integer y=ny0; y < nyf; y++)
{
    for(integer x=nx0; x < nxf; x++)
    {
        for(integer z=nz0; z < nzf; z++)
        {
            const real lrho = rho_TL(rho, z, x, y, dimmz, dimmx);

            const real stx  = stencil_X( _SX, sxptr, dxi, z, x, y, dimmz, dimmx);
            const real sty  = stencil_Y( _SY, syptr, dyi, z, x, y, dimmz, dimmx);
            const real stz  = stencil_Z( _SZ, szptr, dzi, z, x, y, dimmz, dimmx);

            vptr[IDX(z,x,y,dimmz,dimmx)] += (stx  + sty  + stz) * dt * lrho;
        }
    }
}
```

Then compile `fwi` (*make sure  to use* **pgcc** *compiler* and to *enable OpenACC* with **-DUSE_OPENACC=ON** !), and observe the compiler output:

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=pgcc -DUSE_OPENMP=OFF -DUSE_OPENACC=ON ..

              Complex loop carried dependence of sxyptr-> prevents parallelization
              Loop carried dependence due to exposed use of sxxptr[:*] prevents parallelization
...
```

Oops! the compiler detects a dependence and prevents a parallelization (it generates a scalar kernel!). 
Since we know that *vcell_TL* is embarrasingly parallel and there isn't a dependence we have to force the compiler to ignore those dependences and parallelize it.
For that we have to add `#pragma acc loop independent` before each iteration level:
```c
#pragma acc kernels
#pragma acc loop independent
for (integer y=ny0; y < nyf; y++) {
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for (integer x=nx0; x < nxf; x++) {
        #pragma acc loop independent
        for (integer z=nz0; z < nzf; z++) {
```

Then we can compile the application again:
```bash
$ make

> Obs: Functions called from a parallel region (`== CUDA kernel`) should be declared a device function. For that OpenACC provides the `#pragma acc routine <type>` directive.
To speed-up the hands-on lab we already provide the code with those pragmas.
We encourage you to check `include/fwi/fwi_propagator.h` to see how it's done.


#### Benchmark

After implementing all *scell* and *vcell* functions we can proceed to measure the execution time:
```bash
$ make irun
[ 62%] Built target fwi-core
[ 87%] Built target fwi
Scanning dependencies of target irun
[100%] outputs will be in /home/ubuntu/FWI/scripts/output/

```
That is, 13.9x faster than the OpenMP execution.

Remember you can see differences with the soluction with `git diff gtc2018-step1-sol`

## Step 2: Profile the applicaiton

Now discard all non-commited changes and checkout branch `gtc2018-step2`:

Step 2 will profile the application to find possible weaknesses and optimization opportunities. 
We could use *NVIDIA Visual Profiler* for a graphical assestment or `pgprof`/`nvprof` for a command-line visualization. 
For simplicity in this lab we are going to use `nvprof`:
```bash

```
The Critical path is the set of functions which determine the maximum execution time of the application.
Therefore optimization of the critical path should be our first priority.

We can see that *scell* kernels take a good chunck of the critical path.


## Step 3: Express data movement: from CUDA Unified memory to OpenACC data directives

Unified Memory (UM) can be very inefficient in older GPU generations and an experienced programmer with detailed knowledge of the application algorithm could outperform the Unified Memory.

As we have seen in Step 2, `FWI` doesn't specially suffer from too much UM traffic.
But as an example, in this step we'll migrate from UM to a movement of data using OpenACC directives.

OpenACC offers two sets of directives to to move data from host to device depending on the `scope`:
* `#pragma acc data` clause can be used to delcare a `scope` where the data resides in the GPU.
* `#pragma enter data` / `#pragma exit data` for variables that don't have a clear scope (for instance, specially useful for C++ Class constructors & desctructors).

In our case, allocations and deallocations happens in different scopes.
Then, we use `#pragma acc enter data create` and `#pragma acc exit data delete` to increase the locality in the GPU.

##### In sumary:

* Remove the `managed` flag from the `OpenACC_C_FLAGS` in `CMakeLists.txt` (already done).
* Annotate, using OpenACC directives, which arrays will be use on the GPU:

In `alloc_memory_shot` function (`src/fwi_kernel.c`), *after* allocations (`malloc`), declare all missing arrays for `coeff_t` (we already filled `v_t` and `s_t` ones).
Example:

```c
coeff_t cc = *c;
#pragma acc enter data create(cc)
#pragma acc enter data create(cc.c11[:cellsInVolume])
#pragma acc enter data create(cc.c12[:cellsInVolume])
#pragma acc enter data create(/* COMPLETEME */)
#pragma acc enter data create(/* COMPLETEME */)
... // continue with c13,c14,c15,c16, c22,c23,c24,c25,c26, c33,c34,c35,c36, c44,c45,c46, c55,c56, c66
```

In `free_memory_shot` function, *before* all dealocations (`free`) we should first, deallocate the GPU memory with:

```c
#pragma acc wait

#pragma acc exit data delete(c->c11)
#pragma acc exit data delete(c->c12)
#pragma acc exit data delete(/* COMPLETEME */)
#pragma acc exit data delete(/* COMPLETEME */)
...
#pragma acc exit data delete(c)
...
```

* On each parallel region (`acc kerenels`) you have inform the compiler that all the arrays are already on the GPU.
 You can do that with the `present` clause:

For instace in *vcell_TL*:
```c
#pragma acc kernels present(szptr, sxptr, syptr, rho, vptr)
```

And for *scell_TR* kernels:
```c
#pragma acc kernels present(sxxptr, syyptr, szzptr, syzptr, sxzptr, sxyptr) \
                    present(vxu, vxv, vxw)  \
                    present(vyu, vyv, vyw)  \
                    present(vzu, vzv, vzw)  \
                    present(cc11, cc12, cc13, cc14, cc15, cc16) \
                    present(cc22, cc23, cc24, cc25, cc26) \
                    present(cc33, cc34, cc35, cc36) \
                    present(cc44, cc45, cc46) \
                    present(cc55, cc56) \
                    present(cc66)
```

#### Benchmarking

Now we can run the application again:
```bash
$ make irun
[100%] outputs will be in /home/ubuntu/FWI/scripts/output/
PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR: /home/ubuntu/FWI
PROJECT_BINARY_DIR: /home/ubuntu/FWI/build/bin

Number of shots 1
Number of gradient iterations 1
Number of test iterations 1
Output directory path: results
FWI Program finished in 8.401898 seconds
[100%] Built target irun
```
We got a minor speedup of 1.02x. 


## Step 4: Optimize kernel scheduling using multiple threads

OpenACC follows the same semantics as CUDA regarding streams. 
By default, kernels and memory copies are executed in the default stream which imposes serialization between kernels and memory transfers.

Since all *vcell** kernels are independent between each other. 
And all *scell** kernels are independent between each other.
We could launch independent kernels to different streams and we could achieve back-to-back execution.
In the worst case, we can begin execution the moment after the previous kernel left some SM empty.
In the best case (when a kernel doesn't occupy all de SMs), multiple kernels can run in parallel.
Another benefit is that we can perform H2D,D2H & kernel execution in parallel.

OpenACC uses the clause `async` that requires a nonnegative scalar integer as a parameter.
In `include/fwi/fwi_propagator.h::78` we have already prepared an enum that we are going to use as identifiers:
```c
typedef enum {TR, TL, BR, BL} phase_t;
```

We already prepared all `compute_component_scell_*` and `compute_component_vcell*` functions with and additional parameter `phase` that we will use.


##### In sumary:
* In 'velocity_propagator` and `stress_propagator` functions, modify the last parameter of `compute_component_scell_*` and `compute_component_vcell*` functions to pass `TR`, `TL`, `BR` o `BL` values.

* Add the `async(phase)` clause to all `acc kernels` in *scell* and *vcell* functions.

For instance for `vcell_TL` (`src/fwi_propagator.c:168`):
```c
#pragma acc kernels ... async(phase)
```


#### Benchmarking

```
# make irun
[ 62%] Built target fwi-core

[100%] outputs will be in /home/ubuntu/FWI/scripts/output/

[100%] Built target irun
```
We got another 1.03x speedup.

## Step 5:  Add glue code to call CUDA Kernels

`FWI` is a great candidate to take advantage of shuffle intrinsics and shared memory.
OpenACC provides the directive `cache` to exploit shared memory, but there is nothing to exploit CUDA intra-warp intrinsics.

We provide a set of highly optimized kernels in `src/fwi_propagator.cu` file.
We also provide the necessary modifications in `CMakeLists.txt` for compiling with `nvcc` and linking with `pgcc`.
Just remember to pass `-DUSE_OPENACC=ON -DUSE_CUDA_KERNELS=ON` to cmake.


####In summary:
* Compile `FWI` with `-DUSE_OPENACC=ON -DUSE_CUDA_KERNELS=ON`
* Add `#pragma acc host_data use_device` directives to forward the *device pointers* allocated by OpenACC to our CUDA kernels.
* Pass the current stream to the CUDA kernel (with `acc_get_cuda_stream`).

For instance, for `compute_component_vcell_TL_cuda`:
```c
{
#if !defined(USE_CUDA)
    <... previous OpenACC impl. ...>
#else
    void* stream = acc_get_cuda_stream(phase)

    #pragma acc host_data use_device(szptr, sxptr, syptr, rho, vptr)
    {
        compute_component_vcell_TL_cuda(..., stream);
    }
#endif
};
```

## FWI OmpSs/OpenACC

We include an experimental version of the new OmpSs/OpenACC interoperability.

The general idea is to use OmpSs to track the dependences between tasks and manage GPU memory & Streams while using OpenACC to generate GPU kernels without having to use CUDA.

The following example shows an `openacc` OmpSs task:
```bash
const integer size = dimmz * dimmx * dimmy;

#pragma omp target device(openacc) copy_deps
#pragma omp task in( [size]rho, [size]sxptr, [size]syptr, [size]szptr ) inout( [size]vptr ) label(vcell_TL)
#pragma acc kernels deviceptr(rho, sxptr, syptr, szptr, vptr)
#pragma acc loop independent
for(integer y=ny0; y < nyf; y++)
{
    #pragma acc loop independent
    for(integer x=nx0; x < nxf; x++)
    {
        #pragma acc loop independent
        for(integer z=nz0; z < nzf; z++)
        {
            const real lrho = RHO_BL( rho,z,x,y,dimmz,dimmx );

            const real stx = STENCILX( sxptr,SX,dxi,z,x,y,dimmz,dimmx );
            const real sty = STENCILY( syptr,SY,dyi,z,x,y,dimmz,dimmx );
            const real stz = STENCILZ( szptr,SZ,dzi,z,x,y,dimmz,dimmx );

            vptr[IDX(z,x,y,dimmz,dimmx)] += (stx  + sty  + stz) * dt * lrho;
        }
    }
}
```
We only support the `kernels` and `loop` directive with clauses `deviceptr`. 
Any other combination is not supported.
Also, we are restricted to only one GPU.

To build this example:
```bash
cd FWI-sol-ompss-acc
make -i
NX_ARGS="--gpus=1" ./fwi data/fwi_params.txt data/fwi_frequencies.profile.txt
```



# Appendix
## Step 0: Characterize FWI application

The initial step of every paralelization effort is to check whether it makes sense to apply optimizations or not.
In the case of accelerator programming a certain number of questions have to be answered before the first line of code is written.
This includes:
* Understanding the program structure and how data is passed through the call tree
* Profiling the CPU-only version of the application and identifying computationally-intense "hot spots"
* Identify which loop nests dominate the runtime
* Are the loop nests suitable for an accelerator?
* Insuring that the algorithms you are considering for acceleration are safely parallel


Firt. Compile & execute the sequential version of FWI:
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=pgcc ..
$ make
```

Then you execute FWI either using `make irun` or `bin/fwi fwi_schedule.txt`. You should see something like this:
```
Number of frequencies 1
Number of shots 1
Number of gradient iterations 1
Number of test iterations 1
Output directory path: results
FWI Program finished in 1059.629833 seconds
```

Then we are going to profile FWI to search for hot spots using `make iprofile` which will call `nvprof --cpu-profiling on` (or call `nvprof` directly from console: `nvprof --cpu-profiling on bin/fwi fwi_schedule.txt`).

```bash
$ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=pgcc ..
$ make
$ nvprof --cpu-profiling on --cpu-profiling-percentage-threshold 1 bin/fwi fwi_schedule.txt
Number of frequencies 1
Number of shots 1
Number of gradient iterations 1
Number of test iterations 1
Output directory path: results

```
We can see that `scell` and `vcell` functions dominate the execution time.
`IDX` is the function that linearizes the (i,j,k) triplet into the linear index.
Usually the compiler is smart enough to inline it, but in this execution it didn't.
Since we know that `IDX` is only called inside `scell` and `vcell` functions, we can safely split the `IDX` execution time among `scell` and `vcell` functions.
Therefore we can safely say that `scell` and `vcell` accounts for the 99% of the execution time of the application.

If we take a look at those functions in **src/fwi_propagator.c** we will arrive to this conclusions:
1. They are embarrassingly parallel
2. All `TR`/`TR`/`BL`/`BR` are very similar
3. We have to apply the same parallelization strategy for all *scell* and *vcell* functions.

Now we will recompile enabling OpenMP and execute the application to measure the performance of OpenMP vs the serial implementation:
```bash
Number of frequencies 1
Number of shots 1
Number of gradient iterations 1
Number of test iterations 1
Output directory path: results
FWI Program finished in 120.587904 seconds
